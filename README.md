# Puppet Tray
---
This electron task bar app is meant to give you a quick way to see where Puppet is at in its progress.
The color of the icon will tell you if it is completed, in progress or failed.

Click on the icon and you will get more information. The information is pulled from C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\cache\state\last_run_summary.yaml
Currently only for windows.
